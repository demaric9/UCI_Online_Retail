- The largest group is Lost customers (988), shows that many customers are inactive and need re-engagement
- Loyal Customer and Champions still are on strong form, although Champions sit at 204 customers
- Potential Loyalists are high, meaning more strategies focus on them
- High Value at Risk are one to keep an eyes on, they need to be on track
- We have many frequent customers
- CLV is at 228732.4, means that a Customer is expected so spend an amount of 228732 on their full cycle of the business
